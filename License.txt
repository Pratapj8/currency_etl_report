### ✅ Your `index.html` Review

Your `index.html` code looks **great**! Here's a quick review:

- **Form Inputs**: 
   - The form correctly includes input for selecting base currency, target currency, and report date.
   - You have a **POST method** for submitting the form, and the form is well laid out.
   
- **Chart Rendering**: 
   - The chart generated in `app.py` is displayed correctly in the HTML by using a `<img>` tag with the `base64`-encoded image data.
   
- **Biggest Change Section**:
   - This section is well-structured and will display information dynamically if there's any change data available.
   - If there's no data, a fallback message `"No change data available"` is shown.

The only minor improvement I'd suggest is to add some **error handling** in case the data does not exist for certain currency pairs or the date range — but it's not critical right now.

If everything looks good, you should be able to start the project and run it locally. Let me know if you need help with anything else!
